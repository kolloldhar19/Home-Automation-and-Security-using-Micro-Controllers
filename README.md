B-Tech Final Year Project 
Contains the B-Tech thesis describing the entire work flow

Digitization has become the part of human lives. With the advancement of technology, the lives of people
have become easier. One such example can be cited as, in the year 2015, 199 million users in India used
smart phones but with years progressing the number has risen to 401 million users in the year 2020. Not
only smart phones various devices such as Amazon Echo and Google Home which are being incorporated
to our lives. And these numbers are expected to keep on rising. Hence, why not try to digitize the way we
control our houses. An idea of having control of all our appliances right at the tip of our fingers can
become a big topic in the near future because of its potential. Switches would not have to be externally
fitted to the wall. We would not leave the security of our houses to a mere lock and key rather we could
install an entire system along with these methods to take care our security.
At present many technologies are there which have automated houses such as temperature control units,
leak detection, smoke detection, etc. But integrating all these into one single unit would help in making an
easily accessible automation system. Put together a security system with it such as motion detectors and
heat sensors, houses can be transformed into smart homes. Different type of home automation systems
offers a wide range of functions and services, some of the common features are appliance control,
thermostat control, remote control lighting, live video surveillance, monitor security camera, and real time
